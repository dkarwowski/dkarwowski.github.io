After quite a bit of time working on projects on my own, I've decided to start
a blog of sorts. Mostly, this is a website to showcase my work. I plan on
moving some [project][gh-projects] examples onto a page here, as well as some 
sort of resume page. Leaves me with... a lot of work.

I'm new to web development, however I'm even more new to Jekyll. Because of
this, I'm not so sure what I'm trying to get at right now? However, I do plan
on trying to use the blog service somewhat as well. Potentially updates
regarding certain projects, to motivate myself to produce more finished copies. 

I making this more as an exercise for myself than anything else, to see how
much web development I can learn to create customized CSS files to create what
I believe to be a much nicer looking website than what I have at the moment. I
hope to one day look back and see this post as the first of many, on a very
nice looking site. 

Perhaps even my writing will get better.
