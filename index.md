#Hello!

Welcome to my website. My name is David, and you can feel free to [read][about] all about me!

This is just a website where I'll be hosting my projects and resume, as well as an exercise 
in web development. I hope to end up with a few fun web games up on here as I progress with
JS/HTML/CSS.
