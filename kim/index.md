# I fucking love you

So much so that I decided I needed a webpage to say it.

Here's that webpage.

I want you to know that I'm always thinking about you. Thinking about our
future in
[Boston](http://www.avaloncommunities.com/massachusetts/boston-apartments/ava-back-bay)
 and damn anyone else for trying to get in our way. I honestly do plan on
spending the rest of our lives together. With the lovely 
[Butch Cassidy](https://goo.gl/dl4j7g). And the amazing kiddos we'll have
together. Coming back from work with you there too.

I want to come home to you there-- or at least knowing that you'll be there
soon enough. Knowing we get to fall asleep in the same bed, every night.
Knowing that your mine and I'm yours.

And there's the idea of making all of it official. Marrying your beautiful
self. I've been thinking about it for months now. I wish I could. It'd be
enough if I could just convince myself that it was the right time. Alas, I
feel we should wait. Plus I still worry about you saying no.

Maybe the worry will fade.

A part of me hopes it never will.

I want to be striving for everything you want for the rest of my life.
