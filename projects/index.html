            A Risk clone that is still in development, with a <code>master</code> branch that has a working game system.
            Currently in the process of creating a custom map system to define a better map structure, then porting
            over the existing <code>Swing</code> code to <code>JavaFX</code>. Organizing it into an <code>MVC</code>
            structure to decouple most things.

            A 2D top-down game that is being developed from the ground up. Currently I'm using <code>SDL2</code> for
            rendering which will evolve into full OpenGL as the game progresses. A base layer was created to abstract
            away the game code from the <code>SDL2</code> platform. Allows for in-place recompilation and quicker
            development. At the moment entites are being fleshed out.
