# Personal Website

Hello! So this is just the Jekyll source to my personal website. Very simple
stuff, with some customization.

## Theme

I'm using a [Solarized Theme curtesy Matt H.](https://github.com/mattvh/solar-theme-jekyll). 
I've been building up a customization of it, perhaps
eventually being able to call it my own theme. I'll probably end up going
through a few different rounds of themes, this is just the current one.

## Content

The website holds my Resume, as well as what will end up being a few project
pages (especially if I ever get into some damn Web Dev). It'll also be the site
of a Tech Blog I'm trying to work out the kinks for!
